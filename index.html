<!-- The <html> element is the parent of <head> and <body>, which (as children of the same
parent) are siblings. <body> has one child, a <div> element, and that has three children:
an <h1> element and two <p> elements. The <h1> element is a descendant of the <body>
element but not of the <head> element. -->
